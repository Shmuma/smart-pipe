Tools
=====
There are special command-line tools, which can help access smart pipe data files, look inside them,
analize their performance etc.

All of them are inside single python program called **sp.py**, which is added to path automatically on installation
of package (if you're installing smart_pipe package inside VE, you need to activate VE first).
